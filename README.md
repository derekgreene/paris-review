# Overview

This repository provides a Python implementation which applies topic modelling to literary interviews from *The Paris Review*, as described in the following paper:

	Greene, Derek, James O'Sullivan, and Daragh O'Reilly. "Topic Modelling Literary Interviews from The Paris Review." 
 	Digital Scholarship in the Humanities 39.1 (2024): 142-153. https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqad098.

The notebooks provided here can be used to run the experiments described in our paper. The original articles are available separately from *[The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/)* and should be added to the directory 'data/raw'.

The code has been tested in Python 3.9-3.11, and requires the following packages:

- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
